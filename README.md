# N1MM UDP broadcast Listener app
A simple .NET Console application to collect and parse the XML datagrams broadcast over UDP by N1MM Logger+. 
Written mainly for the challenge but the code/concept can be easily re-used for more useful applications such 
as an out-of-band warning bell, a live score-board or software for performance statistics.
